# Compado Challenge

This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) on Front-end and Node.js/Express on the Backend.
The project was deployed on Heroku.com -> [Compado Challenge](https://compado-challenge.herokuapp.com/)

## Exercise

Create a small javascript application that:Connects to the ebay product API.Gets a list of products for a given keyword (or keywords) and allows the user to set a price range to filter products.Displays the results in a list.Make the list and search form as user friendly as possible.Provide styling using a CSS preprocessor. (SASS)Feel free to use existing third party components such as ReactTable or VueTableChoose an existing design upon which to base your applicationâ€™s design, and explain why you choose this design

## Run the app locally

1. ### `git clone https://github.com/pharantes/compado-challenge.git`
2. ### `cd client` && `npm install`
3. ### `cd server` && `npm install`
4. ### `cd client` && `npm start`
5. ### `cd server` && `npm start`

## Deployment on Heroku

Create a project on Heroku.com. I named the project "compado-challenge".
Then, you need to link your Git project with Heroku.

```
# Replace "compado-challenge" by the name of your Heroku project
$ heroku git:remote -a compado-challenge
$ git push heroku master
```

## Improvements

Setup a load more button for the ProductsList component depending on the size of the search object.
This way we could improve speed and usability.
